            <h2>Professional Objective Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    My goal after graduation is to ascend to a higher title either through my current employment with the Lottery or elsewhere. I want others to rely on my expertise to help them with tech issues.<br>
                    Through  working for the lottery and my experience within schooling, I am learning a plethora of knowledge surrounding technology that can help better my future career adventures. Key skills <br>
                    learned throughout my life adventures provided myself with both software and hardware experience. I learned different coding languages through schoooling such as C, Java, Python, SQL, and HTML<br>
                    On the other hand, with work, I have gained hardware experience through working with motherboards, combo boards, bill acceptors, printers, readers, and touch screen troubleshooting. <br>
